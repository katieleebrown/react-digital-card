# React Digital Business Card
This repository is for a digital business card built with react and bootstrap. This react app was initialized with create-react-app and used node to initialize bootstrap. 

# Tech Stack
This is a React and Boostrap project, with some additional HTML, CSS, and JS. 

# Optimizations
My hope is to include a light/dark switch in a future version of this digital business card. Maybe a later version will also allow other devs to create their own cards, adding to a database of devs! 

# Lessons Learned
This was my first solo React project, and my first attempt at combining React with Bootstrap. It took a few attempts to get the bootstrap to render, and I spent some time seeing how various bootstrap components mixed together when imported across different files; in this case, my App.js file held the card container, and I imported the card-header, card-body, card-footer, etc. through various components.
