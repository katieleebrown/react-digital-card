# React Digital Business Card
This repository is for a digital business card built with react and bootstrap. 

# Tech Stack
This is a React and Boostrap project, with some additional HTML, CSS, and JS. 

# Optimizations
My hope is to include a light/dark switch in a future version of this digital business card. Maybe a later version will also allow other devs to create their own cards, adding to a database of devs!

# Lessons Learned
This was my first solo React project, and my first attempt at combining React with Bootstrap. While there were some bumps along the way, I'd say this was a great stepping stone to more complex React projects.
